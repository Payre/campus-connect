\chapter{Expected Results}

The development of the proposed mobile application for the Institute of Engineering Purwanchal Campus (IOEPC) is expected to significantly enhance the efficiency and accessibility of college services. By integrating various administrative and academic tasks into a single platform, the application will address the current challenges of missed notices, reliance on third-party software, and the lack of a centralized system. 

Specifically, the application will:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Provide real-time updates and timely information to students, reducing the dependency on social media and class representatives.
    \item Centralize library management and other college-related work, streamlining processes and improving accessibility.
    \item Offer a scalable and integrable solution that can be easily enhanced in the future to accommodate additional services and functionalities.
\end{itemize}

Overall, the application aims to create a more convenient and efficient platform for students and faculty, ultimately contributing to a better educational experience at IOEPC.
