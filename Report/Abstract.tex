The Institute of Engineering (IOE) in Nepal currently utilizes various disparate platforms for providing services to its students and staff. Campus Connect is being developed as a comprehensive platform with a user-friendly interface integrating all services in one place. This platform aims to integrate existing services while providing additional features through the use of plugin-like technology. The Campus Connect app strives to provide seamless services to its users and enhance the efficiency and centralization of college activities. The Agile methodology approach has been adopted to ensure that Campus Connect meets the requirements of its target audience. Furthermore, the Campus Connect's monolithic architecture allows for simplistic and cost-effective services, which can pave the way for similar applications to be developed for other educational organizations.
