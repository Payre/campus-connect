\section{Monolithic Architecture}
A monolithic architecture is a software design pattern where all components of an application are integrated into a single code base. This approach simplifies deployment and management, as all functionalities are contained within a single codebase. It can be faster in handling request when the number of requests are fixed and the load with less user.
